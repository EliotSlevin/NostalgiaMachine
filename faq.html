    	<h3>I've found a broken video!</h3>
    	<p>Thanks! Follow the instructions <a href="badVideo.html">here</a> to report it.</p>
    	<h3>Who made this sweet website?</h3>
    	<p>Eliot and Jacob</p>
    	<h3>How did you get all the data?</h3>
    	<p>The data is based off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Year-End_Hot_100_singles_of_2015">Billboard year-end hot singles</a> chart. We then used that data to scrape youtube for videos.</p>
    	<h3>Why don't you have <em>[artist name here]</em> ?! They were all the rage!</h3>
    	<p>The billboard chart only tracks american pop music. So if the artist never sold records in america, they might not make the chart, sorry. Also, they might just be too obscure.</p>
    	<h3>How does this site make money?</h3>
    	<p>Fun fact, we don't make any money off this site - but we also dont lose money. It's served 10's of millions of visitors, but it's powered by other fantastic companies. We'd like to thank Github Pages, Youtube, Embedly, Disco.io, and Steve.</p>
      <h3>I liked the old version better!</h3>
